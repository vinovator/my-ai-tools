# Anthropic Productivity Visualizations

> **Inspiration**: This project is an experimental visualization of the concepts presented in [How AI is transforming work at Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic) and [Data Stories: Anthropic Work](https://sanand0.github.io/datastories/anthropic-work/).

This repository contains experimental HTML/JS visualizations illustrating how AI transforms engineering work at Anthropic.

## Visualizations

-   **[productivity-velocity.html](./productivity-velocity.html)**: The initial set of visualizations focusing on engineering velocity.
-   **[organic-metaphors.html](./organic-metaphors.html)**: A second iteration with "Organic Metaphor" styles.
-   **[xenographic-workflows.html](./xenographic-workflows.html)**: The latest set featuring "Xenographic" and diversely animated charts.

## Concept Source

These visualizations are based on the article: [How AI is transforming work at Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic)

## Generation Prompt

The following prompt was used to inspire and generate these tools:

> "This article is about how AI is transforming work at Anthropic. Suggest how the following engineer productivity patterns can be illustrated using interactive animated charts, graphs, or infographics.
>
> Specifically show the before-vs-after impact of AI on these engineer productivity patterns:
>
> 1.  Engineers are getting a lot more done, becoming more "full-stack" (able to succeed at tasks beyond their normal expertise)
> 2.  Engineers are accelerating their learning and iteration speed (tighter feedback loops)
> 3.  Engineers are tackling previously-neglected tasks.
>
> For each pattern, I want 3 different animated graphs.
>
> Define metrics before coding. Pick what will best illustrate the pattern. Generate REALISTIC synthetic data when required, grounded in the article.
> Be diverse. Xenographics are welcome. Novel animation / interaction styles, artistry, xenographics, and diverse chart types are encouraged.
> Be intuitive. A single glance should tell them exactly what insight we are trying to convey.
> Ensure animation. It should be smooth, engaging, and visually appealing. Interactivity is a plus.
> Render this as a single HTML file with tabs for each productivity pattern, and a gallery of animated charts for each pattern.
>
> Extend to 3 more animated graphs each. Be more diverse. Your aim is to give me creative ideas. Xenographics are welcome. Novel animation / interaction styles, artistry, xenographics, and diverse chart types are encouraged."

# Trigonometry Visualized

An interactive unit circle explorer designed to help visualize and understand the fundamental concepts of trigonometry.

## Features

- **Interactive Unit Circle**: Drag and explore angles to see how sine, cosine, and tangent change in real-time.
- **Guided Lessons**: Step-by-step interactive lessons explaining:
  - The Unit Circle
  - Cosine (Horizontal projection)
  - Sine (Vertical projection)
  - The Right Triangle relationship
  - Tangent (Slope)
  - The connection to Sine Waves
- **Wave Visualization**: "Unroll" the circle to see the relationship between circular motion and sine waves.
- **Free Exploration Mode**: Toggle specific visualizations (sin, cos, tan, wave) on and off to focus on what you're studying.
- **Real-time Values**: See exact values for angles (degrees/radians) and trigonometric functions update as you interact.

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation or server required.

## Technologies

- **React**: For UI state and component management.
- **Canvas API**: For high-performance, smooth graphical rendering of the unit circle and wave.
- **Babel**: For in-browser JSX compilation (no build step needed).
